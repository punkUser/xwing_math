// DAMAGE DECK:
// 
// Definitely relevant as they produce additional damage:
// - 5x Direct Hit: Suffer 1 [hit] damage. Then repair this card.
// - 4x Fuel Leak: After you suffer 1 [crit] damage, suffer 1 [hit] damage and repair this card.
// - 2x Hull Breach: Before you would suffer 1 or more [hit] damage, suffer that much [crit] damage instead.
// Also relevant as they affect ship stats:
// - 2x Structural Damage: While you defender, roll 1 fewer defense die.
//
// - 20x "other" cards in the damage deck that we don't consider specifically.
// NOTE: If we look at "exposing" damage cards though we'll have to at least track if they flip immediately or not.
// For now we just consider them generic face-up cards with no additional relevant effects.
//
// Might be relevant in the future for interactions with certain effects:
// - 2x Panicked Pilot: Gain 2 stress tokens. Then repair this card.
//
// As long as we don't model attacker damage cards (self-incflicted or whatever) or actions (token refresh),
// that should be all we need for the moment.
